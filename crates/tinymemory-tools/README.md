# tinymemory-tools

The agent-facing side of TinyMemory, over any `tinymemory_api::MemoryEngine`:

- **`tools`**: seven memory tools a host offers its model, as
  runtime-neutral specs (name, description, JSON Schema) plus one `call`
  entry point that runs them and returns compact JSON.
- **`context`**: the `context.md` compiler, a token-budgeted brief a host
  injects at the start of a session.

The crate has no tool-runtime dependency (no MCP, no `tinytools`). A host
adapts `ToolSpec` to whatever runtime it uses; see
[Adapting to a tool runtime](#adapting-to-a-tool-runtime). The design is
written up in [`docs/architecture/tools.md`](../../docs/architecture/tools.md).

## The tools

| Tool | Kind | Arguments | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `memory_recall` | read | `question`, `filter?`, `limit?`, `instructions?` | `{answer, citations: [...]}` |
| `memory_fetch` | read | `query`, `mode?`, `filter?`, `limit?`, `cursor?` | `{hits: [...], next_cursor?}` |
| `memory_list` | read | `filter?`, `limit?`, `cursor?` | `{items: [...], next_cursor?}` |
| `memory_get` | read | `ids` | `{items: [...], missing: [ids]}` |
| `memory_explore` | read | `facet`, `filter?`, `limit?` | `{facet, buckets: [{value, count}], total, missing, more_buckets, truncated}` |
| `memory_store` | write | one of `learning` / `document` / `conversation`, `tags?` | `{id, replayed}` |
| `memory_forget` | write | `ids` **or** a non-empty `filter` | `{forgotten, skipped: [ids]}` |

Details:

- `limit` is `1..=50`, default `10`. `ids` lists `1..=200` ids.
- `memory_fetch`'s `mode` enum lists exactly the engine's
  `EngineDescriptor::fetch_modes`; with no mode named, `hybrid` is used when
  served, otherwise the engine's first mode. An engine serving no mode gets no
  `memory_fetch` tool at all.
- `memory_store` takes `learning: {text, learning_kind?, confidence?,
  evidence?}` (kind defaults to `fact`, confidence to `0.8`),
  `document: {title?, text}` or `conversation: {turns: [{role, text}]}`.
  Storing the same memory twice is a replay, not a duplicate.
- `memory_explore`'s facets are `kind`, `source`, `source_id`, `workspace`,
  `folder`, `file_path`, `language`, `repo`, `url`, `thread`, `agent`,
  `tool_call` and `tag`. The `namespace` facet is deliberately absent.
- The model-facing `filter` is a subset of `MetaFilter`: `kinds`, `sources`,
  `tags_any`, `workspace`, `folder`, `file_path`, `repo`, `url`, `thread_id`,
  `agent_id`, `observed_after` and `observed_before` (RFC 3339). It never has
  a namespace or a reach.
- A hit renders as `{id, kind, text, score, confidence?, meta}` where `meta`
  is a subset: `source {kind, id?}`, `file_path`, `url`, `thread_id`, `tags`,
  `observed_at`. Scores are rounded to four places. The namespace is never
  rendered.

The exact names and schemas are frozen in
[`tests/fixtures/tool_contracts.json`](tests/fixtures/tool_contracts.json).
A change to them changes what every host's model is told, so the
`tool_contracts` test fails until the fixture is regenerated on purpose:

```sh
BLESS_TOOL_CONTRACTS=1 cargo test -p tinymemory-tools --test tool_contracts
```

## Scoping invariants

This crate exists so that a model can never choose whose memory it touches.
An earlier tool layer let the model pass a namespace, which let one tenant's
agent read another's memory. Here, the namespace and the reach are fixed by
the host in a `ToolScope` and are never tool arguments:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `place: Namespace` | the node every stored item is written to |
| `reach: Option<Reach>` | the nodes every read (and forget) is confined to; `None` reads every namespace |
| `writes: bool` | whether `memory_store` and `memory_forget` are offered |

What the tools enforce:

1. **Writes land at `place`.** `memory_store` builds the item's metadata
   itself: namespace `place`, source `agent`, the model's tags, and
   `observed_at` set to the time of the call.
2. **Reads use the scope's reach.** Every recall, fetch, list and explore
   filter has its `reach` overwritten with the scope's; `memory_get` passes it
   as `GetRequest::reach`, and ids outside it come back as `missing`.
3. **Forget cannot reach out.** By ids, the ids are first read back with
   `get` under the reach and only those found are forgotten; the rest are
   returned as `skipped` and survive. By filter, the model's filter must set
   at least one field (a reach alone would mean "everything in reach") and is
   then confined to the reach.
4. **Attempts are refused, not ignored.** A `namespace` or `reach` key
   anywhere in the arguments, at any depth, is an `Error::InvalidRequest`
   saying the host fixes it. Every schema object sets
   `additionalProperties: false`, and any other unknown key is refused too.

Note that a reach with `inherit` (the default from `Reach::of`) includes the
node's ancestors, so a forget may remove memory the agent shares with its
team or the root. A host that wants forgets confined to the agent's own node
sets `Reach::exact(place)`, or offers read-only tools.

### Building a scope

```rust,ignore
use std::sync::Arc;
use tinymemory_api::{Namespace, Reach};
use tinymemory_tools::MemoryTools;

// Single tenant: root, reads everything, writes enabled.
let tools = MemoryTools::new(engine.clone());

// One agent: writes to its node, reads it and its ancestors, never a sibling.
let agent = MemoryTools::new(engine.clone()).placed_at("team:acme/agent:writer".parse()?);

// Read-only, team-wide.
let auditor = MemoryTools::new(engine)
    .placed_at("team:acme".parse()?)
    .reach(Reach::subtree("team:acme".parse()?))
    .read_only();
```

`placed_at` resets the reach to `Reach::of(place)`, so a placed scope never
reads more than its own branch by accident; call `reach` after it to change
that. `MemoryTools::with_scope` takes a `ToolScope` directly.

## Errors

`MemoryTools::call` returns `tinymemory_api::Result<serde_json::Value>`:

- `Error::InvalidRequest` for an unknown tool name, arguments that are not an
  object, a host-fixed key, an unknown key, or a missing, mistyped or
  out-of-range value. Messages are lowercase and name the tool and the field
  (`memory_list: \`filter.kinds\` \`memo\` is not an item kind`), so they can
  be shown to the model as the tool's error output.
- `Error::Unsupported` for a write tool on read-only tools, and for
  `memory_fetch` on an engine serving no fetch mode. The call is well formed;
  the tools simply do not offer the operation, which is what this variant
  means across the contract.
- Anything the engine returns.

## Adapting to a tool runtime

`ToolSpec` is three fields: `name`, `description` and `parameters` (a JSON
Schema object). Most runtimes want exactly that:

- **MCP**: `name` → `name`, `description` → `description`,
  `parameters` → `inputSchema`. On `tools/call`, pass `arguments` to
  `MemoryTools::call` and return the result serialised as text content;
  return an error result with the error's message on `Err`.
- **OpenAI-style function calling**: `{"type": "function", "function":
  {"name", "description", "parameters"}}`. The schemas are closed objects, so
  they also suit strict mode where the runtime accepts optional properties.
- **Anthropic tool use**: `name`, `description`, `input_schema`.

A typical adapter:

```rust,ignore
for spec in tools.specs() {
    runtime.register(spec.name, spec.description, spec.parameters);
}
// When the model calls a tool:
let output = match tools.call(&call.name, call.arguments).await {
    Ok(value) => value.to_string(),
    Err(error) => format!("error: {error}"),
};
```

Build one `MemoryTools` per agent session from the session's identity, never
from anything the model said. `specs()` is cheap; call it per session so a
read-only or differently scoped agent sees only its own tools.

## `context.md`

`tinymemory_tools::context::compile(&engine, &ContextSpec::default())` recalls
one question per `Brief` (four defaults: about the user, active work,
preferences and standing instructions, recent important events), lists the
stored learnings newest and most confident first, and renders markdown with
`generated_at`, `engine`, `tokens` and `refs` frontmatter. The document fits
`budget_tokens` (default 1,500, four characters per token): learnings are
trimmed first, then the last brief. A failing brief is skipped and logged, and
an empty engine yields an empty document. `ContextSpec::reach` confines the
brief to one agent's part of the tree. Details:
[`docs/architecture/tools.md`](../../docs/architecture/tools.md#contextmd).

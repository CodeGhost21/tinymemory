# `safety` — secret and PII scrubbing

`tinymemory_integrations::safety` (feature `safety`) removes credentials and
personal identifiers from text before a memory host stores it. It is
conservative by design: it would rather redact a harmless string than let a
token or a national ID into a long-lived store. It runs on-device, uses regular
expressions and checksums only, and makes no network calls.

The usual call is [`scrub_item`] on each `StoreItem` just before
`MemoryEngine::store`.

## Public surface

| Item | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `scrub_item`, `scrub_item_with` | Scrub every free text a `StoreItem` carries |
| `sanitize_text`, `sanitize_text_with` | Scrub a string: secrets, then PII |
| `sanitize_json`, `sanitize_json_with` | Scrub a JSON value recursively |
| `has_likely_secret` | Boolean check: does this text look like it holds a credential |
| `has_likely_pii` | Strict boundary check used to *reject* namespaces and keys |
| `has_likely_email` | Boundary check for an ordinary email address |
| `redact_credential_markers` | Only the marker rules, without the PII pass |
| `pii::redact_pii`, `pii::redact_pii_with` | Only the PII pass |
| `Policy`, `BareCardGate` | The single tunable |
| `Sanitized<T>`, `SanitizationReport` | Cleaned value plus a tally of changes |

None of these functions fail or panic at runtime. Every scrubber returns a
`Sanitized<T>`; `report.changed()` says whether anything was replaced.

## What is blocked and what is redacted

A text pass in `sanitize_text_with` runs four stages, in this order:

1. **Private-key blocks are blocked.** A PEM, OpenSSH or PGP private-key block
   is replaced in full by `[REDACTED_PRIVATE_KEY]` and counted in
   `blocked_secret_hits`. Nothing of the block survives.
2. **Credential markers.** The value after `/secret/` in a one-time-secret URL,
   and after a `Bearer ` scheme, becomes `[REDACTED]`. The marker and the
   surrounding prose stay, so memory still records that a link or token was
   shared (see below).
3. **Credential shapes are redacted.** Provider token prefixes (`sk-`,
   `sk-ant-`, `ghp_`, `github_pat_`, `glpat-`, `xox?-`, `AKIA`/`ASIA`, `AIza`,
   `npm_`, `SG.`, Stripe `sk_live_`/`rk_test_` and so on), JWTs, and
   `key=value` assignments whose key is `api_key`, `token`, `password`,
   `secret`, `client_secret` or an OAuth parameter. The matched span becomes
   `[REDACTED]`; for `Bearer` and `api_key` the prefix is kept. Counted in
   `text_redactions`.
4. **PII is redacted.** The `pii` pass replaces each identifier with a typed
   token such as `[REDACTED_PII_CPF]` or `[REDACTED_PII_CREDIT_CARD]`. Counted
   in `pii_redactions`.

`sanitize_json_with` walks objects and arrays:

- A value whose **key** looks sensitive is replaced by `[REDACTED_SECRET]`
  without being read. Keys are compared lowercased with non-alphanumerics
  removed, so `API-Key`, `api_key` and `apiKey` match alike. Exact names
  (`apikey`, `token`, `authorization`, `password`, `secret`, `clientsecret`, …)
  match, as does any key that ends in `token`, `apikey`, `clientsecret` or
  `key`, or contains `password` or `secret`. Counted in `key_redactions`.
- Every other string runs through `sanitize_text_with`.
- Numbers, booleans and null pass through untouched.
- Nesting deeper than 128 levels is not walked: the subtree is replaced by
  `[REDACTED_SECRET]` and counted in `depth_redactions`.

The boolean checks are separate from scrubbing. `has_likely_secret` tests the
block and shape tables (not the markers). `has_likely_pii` uses a stricter
pattern set than content scrubbing; see the PII section.

## The `Policy` knob

`Policy` has one field, `bare_card: BareCardGate`. It decides how a bare
(separator-free) Luhn-valid 13-19 digit run is judged as a credit card:

- `BareCardGate::LuhnOnly` (the default) redacts every Luhn-valid run. This is
  the strictest setting and what the plain functions use.
- `BareCardGate::Corroborated` additionally requires a real network IIN at an
  issued length, or a card keyword within 64 bytes (`card`, `cc`, `pan`,
  `cardNumber`, `信用卡`, `カード`, …). `Policy::corroborated()` builds it.

Separated runs (`4111 1111 1111 1111`) are Luhn-gated under both settings. The
corroborated gate exists because Luhn passes about one in ten arbitrary digit
runs, and 13-digit epoch-millisecond timestamps in stored JSON envelopes were
being corrupted at that rate (opencompany#1201). The TinyCortex engine uses
it; a caller that does not opt in never redacts less than before.

## PII detection pipeline

`pii::redact_pii_with` runs in three steps.

1. **Normalize.** `NormalizedView` builds a copy of the text with zero-width
   characters (U+200B/200C/200D/FEFF/2060/180E) removed, fullwidth digits and
   `．－／：` folded to ASCII, and Arabic-Indic digits folded to ASCII. It keeps
   a byte map back to the original, so `１１１.４４４…` or a digit run with
   zero-width spaces inside cannot slip past.
2. **Prefilter.** `scan_candidates` makes one cheap pass over the bytes and
   sets a flag per identifier class from structural signals: digit-run
   lengths, punctuation, letters, `+`, and keyword probes. Every flag is a
   necessary condition of its class's precise regex, so it can over-fire but
   never under-fire. A class whose flag is unset is skipped, and its regex is
   never compiled.
3. **Match and check.** The precise regex of each flagged class runs on the
   normalized text, in priority order, and each candidate passes its checksum
   or structural gate:

   | Class | Gate |
   | --- | --- |
   | Brazil CPF / CNPJ (formatted or bare) | mod-11 check digits |
   | Argentina CUIT/CUIL (formatted only) | check digit |
   | Credit card | Luhn, plus `Policy` for bare runs |
   | IBAN | mod-97 |
   | India Aadhaar | Verhoeff when grouped; keyword when bare |
   | Spain DNI / NIE | check letter |
   | US SSN | reserved-range filters |
   | UK NINO | reserved-prefix filters |
   | Japan My Number | keyword nearby |
   | Mexico RFC, India PAN, Korea RRN | format only |
   | Phone: E.164, NANP | format (NANP area/exchange rules) |

Overlapping hits are resolved earliest-and-longest first, so a card number is
not also partly redacted as a phone number. The kept hits are spliced back onto
the **original** bytes through the byte map; text that is not PII, including
fullwidth glyphs a user typed on purpose, is left exactly as it was.

### The strict boundary check

`has_likely_pii` decides whether to *reject* a namespace or key, not whether to
rewrite content. It runs the same pipeline but leaves out the patterns whose
only signal is a digit-run shape: bare credit cards, bare CPF/CNPJ, NANP and
E.164 phones. Scanner-built identifiers (WhatsApp JIDs such as
`12025551234-1543890267@g.us`, Telegram peer IDs, millisecond timestamps,
padded counters) would otherwise be rejected constantly. Formatted national IDs
are still rejected. `has_likely_email` is kept apart for the same reason:
identifiers can contain email-like `@` segments legitimately.

## Credential markers

Two leaks get past shape-based matching. Both were seen in a live OpenCompany
deployment that remembered every operator message verbatim:

- **One-time-secret URLs** such as `https://ots.example/secret/<key>`. The key
  is the credential, and it doesn't look like one. The value after `/secret/`
  is redacted; the match is exact and lowercase.
- **Short `Bearer` values.** `Bearer s3cret` is a valid credential, but the
  shape regex needs eight characters. The `Bearer` rule matches the scheme
  case-insensitively and is tuned against the English word, so "ring bearer"
  and "bearer bond" are left alone.

Only the value after the marker is replaced. `redact_credential_markers` runs
just these two rules and returns the input borrowed, without allocating, when
neither marker is present. `sanitize_text` runs them before the shape regexes,
and its `[REDACTED]` is not token-shaped, so a later stage cannot match it
again.

## `scrub_item` per `StoreItem` kind

`scrub_item_with(item, policy)` runs `sanitize_text_with` over each free text
an item carries and merges the reports:

| Kind | Scrubbed | Left alone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Document` | `title`, a `DocumentBody::Text` body | a `DocumentBody::Uri` body |
| `Conversation` | every turn's `text` | turn roles |
| `Learning` | `text`, `evidence` | the learning kind |
| any (metadata) | `meta.url` (query strings carry tokens) | paths, repository, commit, thread and agent ids |

Identifiers in the metadata stay as they are because filters match on them, and
rewriting them would make an item impossible to find. A `Uri` body is left
alone because sources resolve it to text before storing, and that text is
scrubbed at that point. `scrub_item` is `scrub_item_with` under the default,
strictest `Policy`.

## Known limits

- **Pattern-based only.** Contextual PII ("call me at the usual number"),
  combinations (name + employer + city), personal names and free-form dates of
  birth need NER or an LLM and are not handled here.
- **Email addresses are detected, not redacted.** `has_likely_email` reports
  them; the content scrubber leaves them in place.
- **Bare 10-digit NANP numbers are not redacted.** A NANP phone needs
  separators or a leading `1` country code to reach its regex.
- **Unknown credential formats get through.** A token without a known prefix,
  a key-like name, or a marker in front of it is not recognised. Under
  `sanitize_json` a sensitive *key* name still catches it.
- **False positives are accepted.** Shape rules can rewrite harmless text, such
  as a 13-digit timestamp under `LuhnOnly`, or a JSON field whose name ends in
  `key`. A redaction inside structured content can corrupt it for whoever wrote
  it; `Policy::corroborated()` limits that for card-shaped numbers.
- **Not reversible.** Redacted values are dropped, not stored somewhere else.
  The report gives counts, never the original values.

## Testing

Unit tests sit beside each module (`mod_tests.rs`, plus
`sanitize/mod_default_policy_tests.rs` and `pii/mod_prefilter_tests.rs`). They
force every `LazyLock` pattern, so a typo in a built-in regex fails CI rather
than a host. Credential fixtures are assembled at run time so repository secret
scanners don't flag them.

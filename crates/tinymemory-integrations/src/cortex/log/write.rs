//! Appending an item's events.
//!
//! **Direct** sends one experience (`v1/experience?wait=indexed`) or, for a
//! conversation, one ordered batch (`v1/experience/bulk?wait=indexed` with
//! `ordering: strict_temporal`), once — without `?wait=indexed` when the
//! caller only waits for acceptance ([`WaitFor::Accepted`]), so the server
//! answers on capture: a timeout on a write leaves whether it
//! applied unknown, and the store's replay check makes a retry by the caller
//! safe.
//!
//! **TinyHumans** has no bulk route, so a conversation is written one event
//! at a time, in order. Each write carries a random `Idempotency-Key` claim,
//! reused across that write's own retries. The memory API takes the claim
//! before forwarding and keeps it once the engine has been contacted, and
//! answers any replay of a claimed key with 409 without forwarding it. So:
//!
//! - a transient fault (429, 5xx, timeout) is retried under the same claim;
//!   a fault raised before the memory API (the backend's own rate limiter)
//!   left the claim free, and the retry is simply forwarded;
//! - a 409 on a *retry* means the earlier attempt reached the engine and may
//!   have been applied: the outcome is unknown rather than failed, and the
//!   event is looked for (same scope, same item label, same stored text)
//!   until the visibility budget runs out.
//!
//! The stored text names the item id and, for a turn, its index, so finding
//! an event with exactly that text is proof this write (or an identical
//! earlier one) landed.
//!
//! Either way the write then waits for its last event to be readable.

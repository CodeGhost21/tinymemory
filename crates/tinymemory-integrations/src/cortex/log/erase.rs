//! Erasing a whole scope: `POST v1/erasures` with `confirm_all`; and, on
//! the TinyHumans wire, the caller's entire memory: `DELETE memory`.
//!
//! The one place this crate sends `confirm_all`, and never with a selector:
//! the request names exactly one scope, so it erases that scope's events
//! (deleted, not redacted, their write keys released). CortexDB only
//! redacts the scopes below it, which keep their keys; `engine::erase`
//! names kind scopes only (leaves), deepest first, so that never happens.
//!
//! Both wires erase a scope. Direct posts `{scope, confirm_all}` to
//! CortexDB's own `v1/erasures`; hosted posts `{scope, audit_note}` to the
//! TinyHumans backend's `memory/v1/erasures` passthrough (memory-api's
//! scoped erasure, which takes no `confirm_all` and refuses an unknown
//! field). memory-api pins the scope under the caller's tenant root, erases
//! it and every scope below it with the tenant's own user-actor token, and
//! answers synchronously in its own dialect (no `{success,data}` envelope;
//! see `transport`): `{erased: true, scopes, erasure_ids}`, where `scopes:
//! 0` (nothing stored) is still success. `502 ERASURE_INCOMPLETE` is
//! the only failure retried (any other leaves the outcome unknown); re-erasing a scope is safe. A backend without the
//! route answers 404, reported as [`Error::Unsupported`]: nothing was erased.
//!
//! A Direct erasure is a job. CortexDB answers `completed` when it ran to
//! the end before answering; a `running` answer is polled at
//! `v1/erasures/{id}` until it settles, and anything but `completed` is an
//! error: an erasure that did not finish must never read as done.

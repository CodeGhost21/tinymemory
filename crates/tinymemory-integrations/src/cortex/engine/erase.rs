//! Erase: every registered kind scope in reach, deepest first.
//!
//! Only kind scopes are erased, never a node's own path: CortexDB erases a
//! scope's events for good but only redacts the scopes below it, which keep
//! their write keys for 24 hours (a re-sent write then replays and stores
//! nothing; measured on 0.10.5). A kind scope is a leaf (`…/agent:a/app:learnings`
//! and `…/agent:a/agent:b/app:learnings` are siblings), so erasing them
//! deletes every event and releases every key. They are still taken deepest
//! first, so a layout that ever put a scope below another would not strand
//! redacted events behind held keys.
//!
//! On the TinyHumans wire the whole tree (`whole_tree`: the root, its
//! descendants, every kind) erases in one `DELETE memory` that erases the
//! caller's entire hosted memory, every scope under its tenant (including any
//! another layout or client wrote there). A narrower request erases scope by
//! scope, as Direct does, through the backend's `memory/v1/erasures`
//! passthrough, which memory-api pins under the tenant's root (see
//! `log::erase`). A backend without that route answers `Unsupported`, so a
//! caller can fall back to `forget`.

//! Recall: one recall pack per scope, then the answer route once with one
//! of them.
//!
//! The scopes are the filter's (see `scopes`): the kind scopes of its reach,
//! or, with no reach (an unscoped, administrative read), every kind scope the
//! engine holds (`scopes::held`). Each gets its own pack, read exactly (`view: "granular"`),
//! a few at a time, most specific node first. No pack is ever asked of a
//! parent scope: CortexDB fills such a pack from its children in storage
//! order, not by relevance, so it would answer from an arbitrary sample.
//! With no scope to read, the answer is empty and nothing is sent.
//!
//! The answer route is asked once with `use_pack_id` (again, after every
//! pack is built anew, when CortexDB dropped the packs in between, up to
//! three rounds: it drops every pack on any forget), so it answers from
//! exactly the evidence that pack holds: with several packs, the one holding
//! the most admitted events, the most specific node on a tie. **The answer
//! text is grounded on that one pack, while the citations come from every
//! pack.** CortexDB's `/v1/answer` takes one `use_pack_id`, whose scope must
//! match the request's; it has no multi-pack context. The parent-scope pack
//! this replaced was a storage-order sample of the children, so no coverage
//! was lost. Grounding the answer on every scope waits for CortexDB's ranked
//! `subtree` lane (experimental and off by default in 0.10.4).
//!
//! Citations come from the packs' `layers.events`, decoded back to items,
//! filtered by the full [`tinymemory_api::MetaFilter`] (reach included), and
//! merged rank by rank across the packs (each pack's best, the most specific
//! node's first, then each pack's second, …), one per item, at most `limit`.
//! CortexDB scores none of them. A pack with no decodable events still
//! returns the engine's answer, with no citations.

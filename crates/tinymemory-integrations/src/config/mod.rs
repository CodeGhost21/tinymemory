//! [`MemoryConfig`]: which engine a host uses and how each is reached.
//!
//! The config holds no credential. A host keeps its keys in its own secret
//! store and hands one to [`crate::registry::build_engine`] as an
//! [`crate::registry::EngineCredential`], so a config file can be shared or
//! logged.
//!
//! The same shape is read from TOML or JSON:
//!
//! ```toml
//! engine = "cortexdb"
//!
//! [engines.cortexdb]
//! endpoint = "https://cortex.example.com"
//! consolidation = "automatic"   # optional: this server builds beliefs itself
//! ```
//!
//! `engines` is optional, an engine with no entry uses its defaults, and a
//! blank or absent `endpoint` means the engine's default endpoint. Unknown
//! fields are ignored when reading.
